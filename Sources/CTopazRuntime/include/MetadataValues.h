  // gradually-shrinking bitset in case it's useful to track states as
  // separate capabilities.  Specific values have been chosen so that a
  // MetadataRequest of 0 represents a blocking complete request, which
  // is the most likely request from ordinary code.  The total size of a
  // state is kept to 8 bits so that a full request, even with additional
  // flags, can be materialized as a single immediate on common ISAs, and
  // so that the state can be extracted with a byte truncation.

  // states/capabilities are most likely to be added.
